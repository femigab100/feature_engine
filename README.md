# feature_engine
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful inputs that enhance the performance of machine learning models. It involves selecting, creating, and modifying features to better capture the underlying patterns in the data
In this repository, you'll find code implementations for:

- Handling missing values and outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features
- Extracting time-based and domain-specific features
  
These scripts are modular and designed for easy integration into any ML workflow. Whether you're working on regression, classification, or time series problems, this toolkit will help you build smarter models from the ground up.

 Core Libraries
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- Scikit-learn: Provides utilities for encoding, scaling, and feature transformation.
- Datetime: Useful for extracting time-based features.
